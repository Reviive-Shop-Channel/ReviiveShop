 Reviive Shop Channel History!

<hr>
<br>

<span style="color:black;"> January 20, 2024</span> <br>

Reviive Shop Channel started that day, and the team featured Wabagg123, <span style="color:rgb(131, 0, 0);">Dakotath</span>, Chile Coder and <span style="color:rgb(131, 0, 0);">JustWM</span>.
<br><hr><br>
<span style="color:black;">January 28, 2024  </span> <br>
Reviive Shop Channel got the WSC to load, thanks to Wabagg123's work. Our first showcase of the shop was working but was very buggy and had issues.
